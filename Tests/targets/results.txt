Column meaning:
 
TIME

  Times PRIOR to 1962 are UT1, a mean-solar time closely related to the
prior but now-deprecated GMT. Times AFTER 1962 are in UTC, the current
civil or "wall-clock" time-scale. UTC is kept within 0.9 seconds of UT1
using integer leap-seconds for 1972 and later years.

  Conversion from the internal Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) of solar
system dynamics to the non-uniform civil UT time-scale requested for output
has not been determined for UTC times after the next July or January 1st.
Therefore, the last known leap-second is used as a constant over future
intervals.

  Time tags refer to the UT time-scale conversion from TDB on Earth
regardless of observer location within the solar system, although clock
rates may differ due to the local gravity field and no analog to "UT"
may be defined for that location.

  Any 'b' symbol in the 1st-column denotes a B.C. date. First-column blank
(" ") denotes an A.D. date. Calendar dates prior to 1582-Oct-15 are in the
Julian calendar system. Later calendar dates are in the Gregorian system.

  NOTE: "n.a." in output means quantity "not available" at the print-time.
 
SOLAR PRESENCE (OBSERVING SITE)
  Time tag is followed by a blank, then a solar-presence symbol:

       '*'  Daylight (refracted solar upper-limb on or above apparent horizon)
       'C'  Civil twilight/dawn
       'N'  Nautical twilight/dawn
       'A'  Astronomical twilight/dawn
       ' '  Night OR geocentric ephemeris

LUNAR PRESENCE (OBSERVING SITE)
  The solar-presence symbol is immediately followed by a lunar-presence symbol:

       'm'  Refracted upper-limb of Moon on or above apparent horizon
       ' '  Refracted upper-limb of Moon below apparent horizon OR geocentric
            ephemeris
 
 'R.A._____(ICRF)_____DEC' =
  Astrometric right ascension and declination of the target center with
respect to the observing site (coordinate origin) in the reference frame of
the planetary ephemeris (ICRF). Compensated for down-leg light-time delay
aberration.

  Units: RA  in hours-minutes-seconds of time,    HH MM SS.ff{ffff}
         DEC in degrees-minutes-seconds of arc,  sDD MN SC.f{ffff}
 
 'R.A.__(a-apparent)__DEC' =
  Airless apparent right ascension and declination of the target center with
respect to an instantaneous reference frame defined by the Earth equator of-dat
(z-axis) and meridian containing the Earth equinox of-date (x-axis, EOP-correct

TOPOCENTRIC ONLY. Units: HH MM SS.ffff (hours-minutes-seconds of time)
 
 'a-mass mag_ex' =
    RELATIVE optical airmass and visual magnitude extinction. Airmass is the

For planets and natural satellites, output is restricted to solar phase angles
covered by observational data. Outside the observed phase angle range, "n.a."
may be output to avoid extrapolation beyond the limit of model validity.

   For Earth-based observers, the estimated dimming due to atmospheric
absorption (extinction) is available as a separate, requestable quantity.

   Surface brightness is the average airless visual magnitude of a

"n.a." is output.

   Units: ARCSECONDS
 
 'ObsSub-LON ObsSub-LAT' =
   Apparent planetodetic longitude and latitude of the center of the target
disc seen by the OBSERVER at print-time. This is NOT exactly the same as the
"nearest" sub-point for a non-spherical target shape (since the center of
the disc might not be the point closest to the observer), but is generally
very close if not a very irregular body shape. Down-leg light travel-time
from target to observer is taken into account. Latitude is the angle between
the equatorial plane and the line perpendicular to the reference ellipsoid of
the body, so includes body oblateness. The reference ellipsoid is an oblate
spheroid with a single flatness coefficient in which the y-axis body radius
is taken to be the same value as the x-axis radius. Positive longitude is to
the WEST for this target. Cartographic system is given in the header.
   Units: DEGREES DEGREES
 
 'SunSub-LON SunSub-LAT' =
   Apparent sub-solar longitude and latitude of the Sun on the target. The
apparent planetodetic longitude and latitude of the center of the target disc
as seen from the Sun, as seen by the observer at print-time. This is NOT

shape (since the center of the disc seen from the Sun might not be the closest
point to the Sun), but is very close if not a highly irregular body shape.
Light travel-time from Sun to target and from target to observer is taken into
account.  Latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and the line
perpendicular to the reference ellipsoid of the body. The reference ellipsoid
is an oblate spheroid with a single flatness coefficient in which the y-axis
body radius is taken to be the same value as the x-axis radius.  Positive
longitude is to the WEST for this target. Cartographic system is given in the
header.   Units: DEGREES DEGREES
 
 'SN.ang   SN.dist' =
  Targets' apparent sub-solar point position angle (counter-clockwise with
respect to the direction of the true-of-date reference-frame north-pole) and
its angular distance from the sub-observer point (center of disk) at print
time. A negative distance indicates the sub-solar point is on the hidden
hemisphere.  Units: DEGREES and ARCSECONDS
 
 'NP.ang   NP.dist' =
  Targets' apparent north-pole position angle (counter-clockwise with respect
to the direction of the true-of-date reference-frame north-pole) and its
angular distance from the sub-observer point (center of disk) at observation
time.  A negative distance indicates the planets' north-pole is on the hidden
hemisphere.  Units: DEGREES and ARCSECONDS
 
 'hEcl-Lon hEcl-Lat' =

the Sun.  Units: AU and KM/S
 
 'delta      deldot' =
   Apparent range ("delta", light-time aberrated) and range-rate ("delta-dot")
of the target center relative to the observer. A positive "deldot" means the
target center is moving away from the observer, negative indicates movement
toward the observer.  Units: AU and KM/S
 
 '1-way_down_LT' =
   1-way down-leg light-time from target center to observer. The elapsed time
since light (observed at print-time) would have left or reflected off a point
at the center of the target. Units: MINUTES
 
 'VmagSn      VmagOb' =
   Magnitude of target centers' velocity with respect to the Sun ("VmagSn")
and the observer ("VmagOb") at the time light left the target center to be
observed (print time minus down-leg light-time). These are absolute values
of the velocity vectors (total speeds) and do NOT indicate direction of motion.
Units: KM/S
 
 'S-O-T /r' =
   Sun-Observer-Target apparent SOLAR ELONGATION ANGLE seen from the observers'
location at print-time.

   The '/r' column provides a code indicating the targets' apparent position
relative to the Sun in the observers' sky, as described below:

   Case A: For an observing location on the surface of a rotating body, that
body rotational sense is considered:

    /T indicates target TRAILS Sun   (evening sky: rises and sets AFTER Sun)
    /L indicates target LEADS Sun    (morning sky: rises and sets BEFORE Sun)

   Case B: For an observing point that does not have a rotational model (such
as a spacecraft), the "leading" and "trailing" condition is defined by the
observers' heliocentric ORBITAL motion:

    * If continuing in the observers' current direction of heliocentric
       motion would encounter the targets' apparent longitude first, followed
       by the Sun's, the target LEADS the Sun as seen by the observer.

    * If the Sun's apparent longitude would be encountered first, followed
       by the targets', the target TRAILS the Sun.

   Two other codes can be output:
    /* indicates observer is Sun-centered    (undefined)
    /? Target is aligned with Sun center     (no lead or trail)

   The S-O-T solar elongation angle is numerically the minimum separation
angle of the Sun and target in the sky in any direction. It does NOT indicate
the amount of separation in the leading or trailing directions, which would
be defined along the equator of a spherical coordinate system.

   Units: DEGREES
 
 'S-T-O' =

   Difference between the uniform Barycentric Dynamical time-scale and the
Earth-rotation dependent Universal Time. Prior to 1962, the difference is with
respect to UT1 (TDB-UT1) and the 0.002 second maximum amplitude distinction
between TT and TDB is not maintained. For 1962 and later, the difference is
with respect to UTC (TDB-UTC) and periodic terms less than 1.e-6 second are
ignored. Values beyond the next July or January 1st may change if a leap-second
is later required by the IERS. Values from the present date forward through

the angle in the targets' instantaneous orbit plane from the orbital periapse
direction to the target, measured positively in the direction of motion.
The position of the target is taken to be at the moment light seen by the

"PAB-LON" and "PAB-LAT" are the J2000 ecliptic longitude and latitude of the
phase angle bisector direction; the outward directed angle bisecting the arc
created by the apparent vector from Sun to target center and the astrometric
vector from observer to target center. For an otherwise uniform ellipsoid, the
time when its long-axis is perpendicular to the PAB direction approximately
corresponds to lightcurve maximum (or maximum brightness) of the body. PAB is
discussed in Harris et al., Icarus 57, 251-258 (1984).

   Units: DEGREES, DEGREES, DEGREES
 
 'App_Lon_Sun' =
  The apparent target-centered longitude of the Sun ("apparent L_s") as seen at
the target when the light recorded by the observer at print-time reflected off
the target. It is referred to a coordinate system where the x-axis is the
equinox direction defined by the targets' instantaneous IAU2009 pole direction
and heliocentric orbit plane at reflection time, and is measured positively in
an eastward direction (counter-clockwise around the positive pole of the solar
system angular momentum vector). If the target has no associated spin-pole
model (common for asteroids and comets), "n.a." will be output. Units: DEGREES
 
 'RA_(ICRF-a-apparnt)_DEC' =
   Airless apparent right ascension and declination coordinates of the
target in the ICRF reference frame, with down-leg light-time, gravitational
deflection of light, and stellar aberration.

 'I_dRA*cosD I_d(DEC)/dt' =
  The angular rate of change in the targets' ICRF inertial reference-frame
apparent RA and DEC, with light-time, gravitational light deflection, and

provide a linear rate in the plane-of-sky. Units: ARCSECONDS PER HOUR
 
 'Sky_motion  Sky_mot_PA  RelVel-ANG' =
  Total apparent angular rate of the target in the plane-of-sky. "Sky_mot_PA"
is the position angle of the target's direction of motion in the plane-of-sky,
measured counter-clockwise from the apparent of-date north pole direction.
"RelVel-ANG" is the flight path angle of the target's relative motion with
respect to the observer's line-of-sight, in the range [-90,+90], where positive
values indicate motion away from the observer, negative values are toward the
observer:

  -90 = target is moving directly toward the observer
    0 = target is moving at right angles to the observer's line-of-sight
  +90 = target is moving directly away from the observer

UNITS:  ARCSECONDS/MINUTE, DEGREES, DEGREES
 
 'Lun_Sky_Brt  sky_SNR' =
  Sky brightness due to moonlight scattered by Earth's atmosphere at the
target's position in the sky. "sky_SNR" is the visual signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of the target's surface brightness relative to background sky. Output
only for topocentric Earth observers when both the Moon and target are above
the local horizon and the Sun is in astronomical twilight (or further) below
the horizon, and the target is not the Moon or Sun. If all conditions are
not met, "n.a." is output. Galactic brightness, local sky light-pollution
and weather are NOT considered. Lunar opposition surge is considered. The
value returned is accurate under ideal conditions at the approximately 8-23%
level, so is a useful but not definitive value.

  If the target-body radius is also known, "sky_SNR" is output. This is the
approximate visual signal-to-noise ratio of the target's brightness divided
by lunar sky brightness. When sky_SNR < 1, the target is dimmer than the
ideal moonlight-scattering background sky, so unlikely to be detectable at
visual wavelengths. In practice, visibility requires sky_SNR > 1 and a
detector sensitive enough to reach the target's magnitude, even if it isn't
washed out by moonlight. When relating magnitudes and brightness values,
keep in mind their logarithmic relationship m2-m1 = -2.5*log_10(b2/b1).
